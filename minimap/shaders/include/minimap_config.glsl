/*
 * Emily's Minimap Shader Configuration
 *
 * This file contains configuration options for Emily's Minimap Shader, 
 * allowing you to define settings such as position, scale, size, and shape 
 * of the minimap.
 *
 * If you need to style the minimap further, you may need to write a shader 
 * to overlay additional text or elements on top of the minimap.
 *
 * Note: GUI scale is not accessible from within the shader. However, if you 
 * need to scale the minimap dynamically based on screen size, the `ScreenSize` 
 * uniform is available for this purpose.
